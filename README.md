## Analysis Highlights

The Analysis focuses on understanding gun possession behaviour PreCOVID & during COVID, below are the key highlights:
1. Historical the months with the highest background check for obtaining possession of gun were in Nov & Dec (Driven by black friday & holiday sales) but COVID changed that trend and shift in seasonality pattern could be seen.
2. The highest volume for most background checks was during COVID years on non holiday months (2020-03,2021-03) surpassing historical high from 2015-12.
3. There was a sharp increase in private sales, issuance of new guns and returned by law during COVID years.
